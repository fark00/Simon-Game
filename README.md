# Simon-Game

## In this project, we wanted to implement **Simon Game** with **ATMEGA32** microcontroller. We also used the **C** language to write the program.

This project is implemented in a two-person team.(me and [ReyhanehAbtahi](https://github.com/ReyhaneAbtahi))
For more information about this game, you can see [this link](https://www.memozor.com/simon-games/simon-game).
